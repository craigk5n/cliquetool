# Parameters for building dense groups from cliques.
# Format is space-separated with the first column as the group size.
# The second column can either be the required group density
# as a decimal or the required minimum links as a decimal.
# For example, the following two lines achieve the same result:
#   10     8
#   10     0.8
# Note: For gruops larger than any mentioned in this file, the density
# (either specified or calculated from a minimum size integer) of the
# largest specified group will be used.
#
# For College football, most conferences require each team to play at
# least 6 other teams in the conference duing a year.
